\begin{dedication}
To my mother, Diane, who has tirelessly supported me\\
for much longer than reasonable without asking\\
``When will you graduate?''\\
At least not very often\ldots\\
\vspace{0.33\textheight minus 10ex}
To Jin-A Lee, who somehow sustained our relationship\\
from the other side of the world.\\
\vspace{0.11\textheight minus 10ex}
Finally, to all my friends, close or far,\\
but especially those in Cambridge/Jesus College,\\
who have made my time as a PhD student surprisingly enjoyable:\\
