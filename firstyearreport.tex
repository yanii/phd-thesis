\title{First Year Report}
\author{Yani A.~Ioannou}
\maketitle
\thispagestyle{empty}

I transferred to this program having already been in a PhD program since November of 2014, at the University of Bath and Microsoft Research. I have made significant research progress already, and in the course of the degree have authored several papers: 

\begin{itemize}
\footnotesize
    \item \bibentry{segmentation-of-brain-tumor-tissues-with-convolutional-neural-networks}
	\item \footnotemark[1]\bibentry{Ioannou2015}
	\item \footnotemark[1]\bibentry{Ioannou2016}
	\item \bibentry{shankar2016refining}
	\item \footnotemark[1]\bibentry{ioannou2016deep}
	\item \bibentry{bastani2016measuring}
\end{itemize}

I plan to request for an exemption of 3 research terms to be able to submit my dissertation at the end of my second year, and so rather than write a research proposal, I have used the opportunity of this report to create a first draft of my dissertation for comment. The details of the contributions of these papers (marked by \footnotemark[1]) detailed in the acknowledgements section.

Inevitably the following report significantly surpasses the standard first year report length of 15,000 words. In the interests of reader's time, I suggest that feedback be focused on the background and current work sections (last chapter), and the direction and cohesiveness of the dissertation as a whole.
