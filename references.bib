  ABSTRACT = {Although the latest high-end smartphone has powerful CPU and GPU, running deeper convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for complex tasks such as ImageNet classification on mobile devices is challenging. To deploy deep CNNs on mobile devices, we present a simple and effective scheme to compress the entire CNN, which we call one-shot whole network compression. The proposed scheme consists of three steps: (1) rank selection with variational Bayesian matrix factorization, (2) Tucker decomposition on kernel tensor, and (3) fine-tuning to recover accumulated loss of accuracy, and each step can be easily implemented using publicly available tools. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by testing the performance of various compressed CNNs (AlexNet, VGGS, GoogLeNet, and VGG-16) on the smartphone. Significant reductions in model size, runtime, and energy consumption are obtained, at the cost of small loss in accuracy. In addition, we address the important implementation level issue on 1?1 convolution, which is a key operation of inception module of GoogLeNet as well as CNNs compressed by our proposed scheme.},

Our results show that deep networks can be trained using only 16-bit wide fixed-point num- ber representation when using stochastic round- ing, and incur little to no degradation in the classification accuracy. We also demonstrate an energy-efficient hardware accelerator that imple- ments low-precision fixed-point arithmetic with stochastic rounding.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in deep learning have made the use of large, deep neural net- works with tens of millions of parameters suitable for a number of applications that require real-time processing. The sheer size of these networks can represent a challenging computational burden, even for modern CPUs. For this reason, GPUs are routinely used instead to train and run such networks. This paper is a tutorial for students and researchers on some of the techniques that can be used to reduce this computational cost considerably on modern x86 CPUs. We emphasize data layout, batching of the computation, the use of SSE2 instructions, and particularly leverage SSSE3 and SSE4 fixed-point instructions which provide a 3× improve- ment over an optimized floating-point baseline. We use speech recognition as an example task, and show that a real-time hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network (HMM/NN) large vocabulary system can be built with a 10× speedup over an unoptimized baseline and a 4× speedup over an aggressively optimized floating-point baseline at no cost in accuracy. The techniques described extend readily to neural network training and provide an effective alternative to the use of specialized hardware.},

Given only a few weight values for each feature it is possible to accurately predict the remaining values. Moreover, we show that not only can the parameter values be predicted, but many of them need not be learned at all. We train several different architectures by learning only a small number of weights and predicting the rest. In the best case we are able to predict more than 95{\%} of the weights of a network without any drop in accuracy.},

  ABSTRACT = {Scene recognition is one of the hallmark tasks of computer vision, allowing definition of a context for object recognition. Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers' responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.},

  ABSTRACT = {Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it difficult to learn a good set of filters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is significantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present techniques for speeding up the test-time evaluation of large convolutional networks, designed for object recognition tasks. These models deliver impressive accuracy but each image evaluation requires millions of floating point operations, making their deployment on smartphones and Internet-scale clusters problematic. The computation is dominated by the convolution operations in the lower layers of the model. We exploit the linear structure present within the convolutional filters to derive approximations that significantly reduce the required computation. Using large state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate we demonstrate speedups of convolutional layers on both CPU and GPU by a factor of 2x, while keeping the accuracy within 1{\%} of the original model.},

  ABSTRACT = {Learning filters to produce sparse image representations in terms of $\backslash$nover complete dictionaries has emerged as a powerful way to create image $\backslash$nfeatures for many different purposes. Unfortunately, these filters are usually $\backslash$nboth numerous and non-separable, making their use computationally expensive. In $\backslash$nthis paper, we show that such filters can be computed as linear combinations of $\backslash$na smaller number of separable ones, thus greatly reducing the computational $\backslash$ncomplexity at no cost in terms of performance. This makes filter learning $\backslash$napproaches practical even for large images or 3D volumes, and we show that we $\backslash$nsignificantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on the linear structure $\backslash$nextraction task, in terms of both accuracy and speed. Moreover, our approach is $\backslash$ngeneral and can be used on generic filter banks to reduce the complexity of the $\backslash$nconvolutions.},

@ARTICLE{journals/corr/LebedevGROL14,
  ABSTRACT = {We propose a simple two-step approach for speeding up convolution layers within large convolutional neural networks based on tensor decomposition and discrim-inative fine-tuning. Given a layer, we use non-linear least squares to compute a low-rank CP-decomposition of the 4D convolution kernel tensor into a sum of a small number of rank-one tensors. At the second step, this decomposition is used to replace the original convolutional layer with a sequence of four convolutional layers with small kernels. After such replacement, the entire network is fine-tuned on the training data using standard backpropagation process. We evaluate this approach on two CNNs and show that it yields larger CPU speedups at the cost of lower accuracy drops compared to previous approaches. For the 36-class character classification CNN, our approach obtains a 8.5x CPU speedup of the whole network with only minor accuracy drop (1{\%} from 91{\%} to 90{\%}). For the standard ImageNet architecture (AlexNet), the approach speeds up the second convolution layer by a factor of 4x at the cost of 1{\%} increase of the overall top-5 classification error.},

  ABSTRACT = {Convolutional networks are one of the most widely employed architectures in computer vision and machine learning. In order to leverage their ability to learn complex functions, large amounts of data are required for training. Training a large convolutional network to produce state-of-the-art results can take weeks, even when using modern GPUs. Producing labels using a trained network can also be costly when dealing with web-scale datasets. In this work, we present a simple algorithm which accelerates training and inference by a signiﬁcant factor, and can yield improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. This is done by computing convolutions as pointwise products in the Fourier domain while reusing the same transformed feature map many times. The algorithm is implemented on a GPU architecture and addresses a number of related challenges.},

  ABSTRACT = {Discrete Fourier transforms provide a significant speedup in the computation of convolutions in deep learning. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its ad- vantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a powerful representation in which to model and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We employ spectral representations to introduce a number of innovations to CNN design. First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality re- duction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This approach preserves considerably more information per parameter than other pooling strate- gies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output dimensionality. This representation also enables a new form of stochastic regularization by random- ized modification of resolution. We show that these methods achieve competitive results on classification and approximation tasks, without using any dropout or max-pooling. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of complex-coefficient spectral param- eterization of convolutional filters. While this leaves the underlying model un- changed, it results in a representation that greatly facilitates optimization. We observe on a variety of popular CNN configurations that this leads to significantly faster convergence during training. 1},

  ABSTRACT = {As deep nets are increasingly used in applications suited for mobile devices, a fundamental dilemma becomes apparent: the trend in deep learning is to grow models to absorb ever-increasing data set sizes; however mobile devices are designed with very little memory and cannot store such large models. We present a novel network architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets, and all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during training. Our hashing procedure introduces no additional memory overhead, and we demonstrate on several benchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements of neural networks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a new method to quickly and accurately predict 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image, using no temporal information. We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching.},

  ABSTRACT = {This work addresses the challenging problem of simultaneously segmenting multiple anatomical structures in highly varied CT scans. We propose the entangled decision forest (EDF) as a new discriminative classifier which augments the state of the art decision forest, resulting in higher prediction accuracy and shortened decision time. Our main contribution is two-fold. First, we propose entangling the binary tests applied at each tree node in the forest, such that the test result can depend on the result of tests applied earlier in the same tree and at image points offset from the voxel to be classified. This is demonstrated to improve accuracy and capture long-range semantic context. Second, during training, we propose injecting randomness in a guided way, in which node feature types and parameters are randomly drawn from a learned (nonuniform) distribution. This further improves classification accuracy. We assess our probabilistic anatomy segmentation technique using a labeled database of CT image volumes of 250 different patients from various scan protocols and scanner vendors. In each volume, 12 anatomical structures have been manually segmented. The database comprises highly varied body shapes and sizes, a wide array of pathologies, scan resolutions, and diverse contrast agents. Quantitative comparisons with state of the art algorithms demonstrate both superior test accuracy and computational efficiency.},
