  ABSTRACT = {We present an integrated framework for using Convolutional Networks for classification, localization and detection. We show how a multiscale and sliding window approach can be efficiently implemented within a ConvNet. We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called OverFeat.},

  ABSTRACT = {Deep residual networks have emerged as a family of extremely deep architectures showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which further makes training easy and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10/100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet.},

  ABSTRACT = {We have used information-theoretic ideas to derive a class of practical and nearly optimal schemes for adapting the size of a neural network. By removing unimportant weights from a network, several improvements can be expected: better generalization, fewer training examples required, and improved speed of learning and/or classification. The basic idea is to use second-derivative information to make a tradeoff between network complexity and training set error. Experiments confirm the usefulness of the methods on a real-world application.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recordings were made in lightly anaesthesized cats whose retinas were stimulated, singly or together, with light spots of various sizes and shapes. Receptive fields, defined as restricted areas where illumination influenced the firing of a single cortical unit, usually contained mutually antagonistic excitatory and inhibitory regions. Thus a stimulus covering a whole field was relatively ineffective in driving most units. Effective driving of a unit required a stimulus specific in form, size, position, and orientation; based on the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas. About 20{\%} of the cortical units studied could be activated from either eye; these were driven from roughly homologous regions of the retinas and summation and antagonism could be shown.

  ABSTRACT = {Although the latest high-end smartphone has powerful CPU and GPU, running deeper convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for complex tasks such as ImageNet classification on mobile devices is challenging. To deploy deep CNNs on mobile devices, we present a simple and effective scheme to compress the entire CNN, which we call one-shot whole network compression. The proposed scheme consists of three steps: (1) rank selection with variational Bayesian matrix factorization, (2) Tucker decomposition on kernel tensor, and (3) fine-tuning to recover accumulated loss of accuracy, and each step can be easily implemented using publicly available tools. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by testing the performance of various compressed CNNs (AlexNet, VGGS, GoogLeNet, and VGG-16) on the smartphone. Significant reductions in model size, runtime, and energy consumption are obtained, at the cost of small loss in accuracy. In addition, we address the important implementation level issue on 1?1 convolution, which is a key operation of inception module of GoogLeNet as well as CNNs compressed by our proposed scheme.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in deep learning have made the use of large, deep neural net- works with tens of millions of parameters suitable for a number of applications that require real-time processing. The sheer size of these networks can represent a challenging computational burden, even for modern CPUs. For this reason, GPUs are routinely used instead to train and run such networks. This paper is a tutorial for students and researchers on some of the techniques that can be used to reduce this computational cost considerably on modern x86 CPUs. We emphasize data layout, batching of the computation, the use of SSE2 instructions, and particularly leverage SSSE3 and SSE4 fixed-point instructions which provide a 3× improve- ment over an optimized floating-point baseline. We use speech recognition as an example task, and show that a real-time hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network (HMM/NN) large vocabulary system can be built with a 10× speedup over an unoptimized baseline and a 4× speedup over an aggressively optimized floating-point baseline at no cost in accuracy. The techniques described extend readily to neural network training and provide an effective alternative to the use of specialized hardware.},

  ABSTRACT = {Scene recognition is one of the hallmark tasks of computer vision, allowing definition of a context for object recognition. Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers' responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.},

  ABSTRACT = {Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it difficult to learn a good set of filters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is significantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a simple two-step approach for speeding up convolution layers within large convolutional neural networks based on tensor decomposition and discrim-inative fine-tuning. Given a layer, we use non-linear least squares to compute a low-rank CP-decomposition of the 4D convolution kernel tensor into a sum of a small number of rank-one tensors. At the second step, this decomposition is used to replace the original convolutional layer with a sequence of four convolutional layers with small kernels. After such replacement, the entire network is fine-tuned on the training data using standard backpropagation process. We evaluate this approach on two CNNs and show that it yields larger CPU speedups at the cost of lower accuracy drops compared to previous approaches. For the 36-class character classification CNN, our approach obtains a 8.5x CPU speedup of the whole network with only minor accuracy drop (1{\%} from 91{\%} to 90{\%}). For the standard ImageNet architecture (AlexNet), the approach speeds up the second convolution layer by a factor of 4x at the cost of 1{\%} increase of the overall top-5 classification error.},

  ABSTRACT = {Convolutional networks are one of the most widely employed architectures in computer vision and machine learning. In order to leverage their ability to learn complex functions, large amounts of data are required for training. Training a large convolutional network to produce state-of-the-art results can take weeks, even when using modern GPUs. Producing labels using a trained network can also be costly when dealing with web-scale datasets. In this work, we present a simple algorithm which accelerates training and inference by a signiﬁcant factor, and can yield improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. This is done by computing convolutions as pointwise products in the Fourier domain while reusing the same transformed feature map many times. The algorithm is implemented on a GPU architecture and addresses a number of related challenges.},

  ABSTRACT = {Discrete Fourier transforms provide a significant speedup in the computation of convolutions in deep learning. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its ad- vantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a powerful representation in which to model and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We employ spectral representations to introduce a number of innovations to CNN design. First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality re- duction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This approach preserves considerably more information per parameter than other pooling strate- gies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output dimensionality. This representation also enables a new form of stochastic regularization by random- ized modification of resolution. We show that these methods achieve competitive results on classification and approximation tasks, without using any dropout or max-pooling. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of complex-coefficient spectral param- eterization of convolutional filters. While this leaves the underlying model un- changed, it results in a representation that greatly facilitates optimization. We observe on a variety of popular CNN configurations that this leads to significantly faster convergence during training. 1},

  ABSTRACT = {As deep nets are increasingly used in applications suited for mobile devices, a fundamental dilemma becomes apparent: the trend in deep learning is to grow models to absorb ever-increasing data set sizes; however mobile devices are designed with very little memory and cannot store such large models. We present a novel network architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets, and all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during training. Our hashing procedure introduces no additional memory overhead, and we demonstrate on several benchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements of neural networks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a new method to quickly and accurately predict 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image, using no temporal information. We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching.},

  ABSTRACT = {This work addresses the challenging problem of simultaneously segmenting multiple anatomical structures in highly varied CT scans. We propose the entangled decision forest (EDF) as a new discriminative classifier which augments the state of the art decision forest, resulting in higher prediction accuracy and shortened decision time. Our main contribution is two-fold. First, we propose entangling the binary tests applied at each tree node in the forest, such that the test result can depend on the result of tests applied earlier in the same tree and at image points offset from the voxel to be classified. This is demonstrated to improve accuracy and capture long-range semantic context. Second, during training, we propose injecting randomness in a guided way, in which node feature types and parameters are randomly drawn from a learned (nonuniform) distribution. This further improves classification accuracy. We assess our probabilistic anatomy segmentation technique using a labeled database of CT image volumes of 250 different patients from various scan protocols and scanner vendors. In each volume, 12 anatomical structures have been manually segmented. The database comprises highly varied body shapes and sizes, a wide array of pathologies, scan resolutions, and diverse contrast agents. Quantitative comparisons with state of the art algorithms demonstrate both superior test accuracy and computational efficiency.},
